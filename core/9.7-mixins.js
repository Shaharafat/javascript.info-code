// üëÄ Mixins
/**
 * In JavaScript we can only inherit from a single object. There can be only one [[Prototype]] for an object. And a class may extend only one other class.

But sometimes that feels limiting. For instance, we have a class StreetSweeper and a class Bicycle, and want to make their mix: a StreetSweepingBicycle.

Or we have a class User and a class EventEmitter that implements event generation, and we‚Äôd like to add the functionality of EventEmitter to User, so that our users can emit events.

There‚Äôs a concept that can help here, called ‚Äúmixins‚Äù.

As defined in Wikipedia, a mixin is a class containing methods that can be used by other classes without a need to inherit from it.

In other words, a mixin provides methods that implement a certain behavior, but we do not use it alone, we use it to add the behavior to other classes.
