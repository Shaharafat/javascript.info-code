      cancelable: true/false – if true, then the “default action” may be prevented. Later we’ll see what it means for custom events.
     * By default both are false: {bubbles: false, cancelable: false}.

      // element using the call elem.dispatchEvent(event)

    MouseEvent, KeyboardEvent and others
    Here’s a short list of classes for UI Events from the UI Event specification:

    UIEvent
    FocusEvent
    MouseEvent
    WheelEvent
    KeyboardEvent
    …
    We should use them instead of new Event if we want to create such events. For instance, new MouseEvent("click").

    The right constructor allows to specify standard properties for that type of event.
    */

      let mouseEvent = new MouseEvent("click", {
        bubbles: true,
        cancelable: true,
        clientX: 100,
        clientY: 100,
      });
      alert(mouseEvent.clientY);

      // 👆 generic Event constructor does not allot that.

      // 👀 event.preventDefault()
      /*
     Many browser events have a “default action”, such as nagivating to a link, starting a selection, and so on.

    For new, custom events, there are definitely no default browser actions, but a code that dispatches such event may have its own plans what to do after triggering the event.

    By calling event.preventDefault(), an event handler may send a signal that those actions should be canceled.

    In that case the call to elem.dispatchEvent(event) returns false. And the code that dispatched it knows that it shouldn’t continue.

    Let’s see a practical example – a hiding rabbit (could be a closing menu or something else).

    Below you can see a #rabbit and hide() function that dispatches "hide" event on it, to let all interested parties know that the rabbit is going to hide.

    Any handler can listen for that event with rabbit.addEventListener('hide',...) and, if needed, cancel the action using event.preventDefault() 
    */
      let rabbit = document.querySelector("#rabbit");

      function hide() {
        let event = new CustomEvent("hide", {
          cancelable: true, // without this flag preventDefault doesn't work/
        });
        if (!rabbit.dispatchEvent(event)) {
          alert("the action was prevented by a handler");
        } else {
          rabbit.hidden = true;
        }
      }

      rabbit.addEventListener("hide", function (event) {
        if (confirm("Call preventDefault?")) {
          event.preventDefault();
        }
      });

      // 👀 Events-in-events are synchronous
      /*
       * Usually events are processed in a queue. That is: if the browser is processing onclick and a new event occurs, e.g. mouse moved, then it’s handing is queued up, corresponding mousemove handlers will be called after onclick processing is finished.

       * The notable exception is when one event is initiated from within another one, e.g. using dispatchEvent. Such events are processed immediately: the new event handlers are called, and then the current event handling is resumed.

       * For instance, in the code below the menu-open event is triggered during the onclick.
      */

      let menu = document.querySelector("#menu");
      // menu.onclick = function () {
      //   alert(1);

      //   // this will be resolved before onclick event occur.
      //   menu.dispatchEvent(
      //     new CustomEvent("menu-open", {
      //       bubbles: true,
      //     })
      //   );

      //   alert(2);
      // };

      // document.addEventListener("menu-open", () => {
      //   alert("nested");
      // });

      /* Please note that the nested event menu-open is caught on the document. The propagation and handling of the nested event is finished before the processing gets back to the outer code (onclick).

      That’s not only about dispatchEvent, there are other cases. If an event handler calls methods that trigger to other events – they are too processed synchronously, in a nested fashion.

      Let’s say we don’t like it. We’d want onclick to be fully processed first, independently from menu-open or any other nested events.

      Then we can either put the dispatchEvent (or another event-triggering call) at the end of onclick or, maybe better, wrap it in the zero-delay setTimeout:
      
      */

      menu.onclick = function () {
        alert(1);

        setTimeout(() =>
          menu.dispatchEvent(
            new CustomEvent("menu-open", {
              bubbles: true,
            })
          )
        );

        alert(2);
      };
